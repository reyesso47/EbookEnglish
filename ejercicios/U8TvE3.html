                Until very recently television broadcasting had been mostly unchanged since the 1950s. Broadcasting has long used antennae to transmit images and sound using the radio espectrum. A receiving antena, usually on the roof of homes, receives the signal and demodulates it to provide the sound and images to a cathode ray tube (CRT). Viewers had to watch programmes according to the transmission schedule set by the TV broadcasand use a video tape recorder to viewprogrammes that they missed.
                    <br></br>
                But the rapid increase in digitization and broadband networking has changed all that. Now content makerslarge and small, old and new, can use the internet or IP networks to distribute content.IPTV can provide live multicast TV services to a number of users, normally subscribers to a service. A unicast VOD service provides the playback of video to the viewer's set-top box or computer.
                    <br></br>
                The key advance that has enabled these services is the massive increase in low-cost broadband services into homes.
                In the past, lack of bandwidth restricted the use of video over the internet, but now content can be compressed into MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 formats, broken into IP packets and streamed across the networks into people's homes.

                 Here it is decoded by a set-top box or played back with a media player on a PC. This is all having an impact on viewing habits. Presented with an EPG containing not only today's programmes but last month's, viewers can now watch things when they want to watch them, not when broadcasters want to transmit them. Even during a programme viewers can pause or rewind to see the goal they just missed, or listen again to the point made in a documentary. And if they do still miss a whole programme,they can record and store the data on the hard disk of their PVR(Personal Video Recorder).                   
                <br></br>
                Even the business models are changing, pay per view is already common and may yet replace the income from advertising or licence fees. Viewers are now watching content on LCD flat Screens, PCs, or even mobile phones instead of bulky CTRs.
                    <br></br>
                Two problems are crated by all of these changes. Content makes worry that digital content is easily copied for free, although digital rights management provides some protection. Advertiserss are now worried their content isn't watched at all as the viewers now have so much control they can fast forward through adverts.
